          <div class="left">
            <p><strong>The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)</strong> is a
              legal framework which provides a set of requirements that we must
               adhere to.  This helps us to ensure that all children who attend
               our pre school are safe and healthy, and that they are supported
               to learn and develop to their full potential. </p>

            <p>We are inspected and regulated by Ofsted on the quality of our
              childcare provision against the requirements of the EYFS. You can
              download the EYFS at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pre-school.org.uk/whats-new/new-eyfs">www.pre-school.org.uk/whats-new/new-eyfs</a> and
               our Ofsted report at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report">www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report.</a></p>
            <p><strong>How we support your child's learning and development</strong><br>
              There are seven areas of learning and development within the EYFS.
              These areas form the basis of the activities we provide for your child,
               which together with knowledge of their unique interests and needs,
               enable us to plan for their progress.
            </p>

            <p>Prime areas of learning and development:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Communication and language</li>
              <li>Physical development</li>
              <li>Personal, social and emotional development</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Specific areas of learning and development:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Literacy</li>
              <li>Mathematics</li>
              <li>Understanding the world</li>
              <li>Expressive arts and design.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These areas are connected, with learning and development in
              each area contributing towards that of the others. Building
              confidence in the prime areas of learning and development is
              particularly important for children, as it enables them to
              progress well in the specific areas of learning and development.
              As we support your child towards achieving the early learning
              goals for each of these areas of learning, we aim to tailor the
              opportunities we provide to meet their personal learning and
              development needs.</p>
