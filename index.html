          <!-- First paragraph and image of children -->
          <div class="left">
            <p>We are a friendly community group in Romsey, Hampshire who offer
              Early Years care and education for children aged from 2 years 9
              months to school age. We are lucky enough to be able to meet in
              a new, bright and modern purpose built playroom next to Cupernham
              Infant School, with our own entrance and secure outside play area.</p>

          <!-- Second paragraph and image of children -->
          <div class="left">
            <p>We organise our sessions so that the children can choose from a
              range of activities and experiences both inside and outside our
              playroom and also in the extensive Cupernham school grounds. Our
              supportive staff are on hand to help children gain new skills,
              make friendships and have fun. </p>
