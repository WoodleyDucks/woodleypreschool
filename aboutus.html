          <h2>About us</h2>

          <!-- First paragraph and image of children -->
          <div class="left">
            <p>Woodley Pre-school is a registered charity which is run by a
            committee of Pre-school parents and carers.</p>

            <p>It was first started by a local mother in the late 1960's to
              provide social opportunities for the other local families and
              their children. As Woodley "Playgroup" it met in the old Village
              Hall and as the years progressed the demand for places saw it
              outgrow its accommodation. Additional sessions were then offered
              in the old Scout hut nearby until 2004 when the two groups
              combined and relocated to its present home on the Cupernham
              Schools site. In April 2013, Peppa Pig was on hand to help
              open the brand new purpose built Pre-school playroom.</p>

          <!-- This bit just fixes bugs -->

          <p>Our aims as a Pre-school are to ensure that each of our children:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>is given personal care and attention and has the support of a
              key person</li>
            <li>has the chance to join with other children and adults to play
               and learn together in a safe and stimulating environment</li>
            <li>is in a pre-school managed and shaped by its parents</li>
            <li>is in a pre-school that sees parents as partners in helping each child fulfil their potential</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We have a maximum of 24 children per session and our ratios are
            1:4 where children are under 3 years and 1:8 for 3 years and over.</p>
